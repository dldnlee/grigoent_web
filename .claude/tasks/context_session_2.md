# Context Session 2: Artist Page Development

## Task Overview
Create an artist page for GRIGO Entertainment Landing Web with the following requirements:
- Two main sections: Solo Dancers and Team Dancers
- Search functionality for both English and Korean names
- Spotify-style UI design approach
- Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Supabase integration

## Current Status
- Starting development of artist page
- Need to consult with shadcn-ui-expert for Spotify-style UI design
- Will implement search functionality and dancer sections

## Database Context
Based on previous session context, the project uses Supabase with dancer management capabilities.

## Next Steps
1. Consult UI expert for design approach
2. Analyze existing database structure for dancers
3. Implement page with search and sections
4. Test functionality

## Research Completed
