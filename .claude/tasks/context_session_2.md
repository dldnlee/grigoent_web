# Context Session 2: Artist Page Development

## Task Overview
Create an artist page for GRIGO Entertainment Landing Web with the following requirements:
- Two main sections: Solo Dancers and Team Dancers
- Search functionality for both English and Korean names
- Spotify-style UI design approach
- Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Supabase integration

## Current Status
- Starting development of artist page
- Need to consult with shadcn-ui-expert for Spotify-style UI design
- Will implement search functionality and dancer sections

## Database Context
Based on previous session context, the project uses Supabase with dancer management capabilities.

## Next Steps
1. Consult UI expert for design approach
2. Analyze existing database structure for dancers
3. Implement page with search and sections
4. Test functionality

## Research Completed
- **Spotify UI Analysis**: Researched Spotify's 2024 design language, including their "Encore" design system, dark theme approach, and typography patterns
- **Component Analysis**: Analyzed existing Artists.tsx component and available shadcn/ui components
- **Design Requirements**: Defined comprehensive requirements for search functionality, section organization, and card layouts

## Key Findings
- Spotify uses dark-first design with deep purple (#400073) and green (#1DB954) accents
- Current project already has dark theme support and necessary dependencies
- Need to install additional shadcn/ui components: input, command, card, badge, button, tabs, skeleton, scroll-area, select, toggle-group
- Existing artist data model can be extended to support solo/team categorization

## Implementation Plan Created
Created comprehensive documentation at `.claude/doc/spotify-style-artist-page-implementation.md` covering:
- Detailed design specifications following Spotify's 2024 patterns
- Component architecture and file structure
- Color scheme and typography system
- Animation and micro-interaction patterns
- Responsive design breakpoints
- Accessibility considerations
- Performance optimization strategies
- 3-phase implementation timeline

## Implementation Details

### Components Created
1. **ArtistSearch.tsx** - Search component with debounced search, Korean/English support
